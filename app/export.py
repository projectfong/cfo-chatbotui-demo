export.py (public demo placeholder)

Purpose:
    This module is intentionally left without executable code in the public demo.
    In the private/full implementation, it provides export utilities for
    compliance-friendly snapshots of application activity (e.g., chat sessions,
    message transcripts, and selected metadata) to formats such as JSON/CSV.

What it does in the full/private build:
    - Collects user-facing conversation data and selected system metadata
      (timestamps, request/response sizes, high-level routing outcomes).
    - Redacts or omits sensitive fields by design (e.g., tokens, secrets,
      internal hostnames, IPs, low-level traces).
    - Normalizes records to a stable schema for audit review and incident analysis.
    - Writes files with ISO 8601 UTC timestamps in filenames for traceability.
    - Produces small, portable artifacts suitable for offline review.

Audit & Safety Considerations:
    - All exported records are timestamped (UTC, ISO 8601).
    - Personally identifiable information and credentials are not included.
    - Internal infrastructure details (FQDNs, IPs, secrets) are never emitted.
    - Export operations are logged to standard output to maintain a visible audit trail.

Notes:
    This placeholder communicates intent and scope without exposing private code,
    internal data structures, or environment-specific logic.
